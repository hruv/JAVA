//Interpreter Vs Compliler :
//The interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code. On the other hand,
// the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code
//compiler is faster than interpreter



//Interpreter :
//one statement at a time
//An interpreter is needed every time
//Partial execution if an error occurs in the program.
//Easy for programmers.

//Compiler :
//Entire program at a time
//Once compiled, it is not needed
//No execution if an error occurs
